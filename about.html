        Count which side is winning, assuming no komi and no prisoners. All positions have the same number of black and white stones, and there are no sekis, so area scoring and territory scoring should give the same result. The positions are manually generated, so there's a relatively small number of them (81 at the moment). To avoid tempting you to memorize specific position, for many of them I've included a very similar position where the result is the opposite.

        It's more of a practice tool than a game, but I've gamified it slightly by giving you 60 seconds to solve as many boards as possible. If you get one wrong or run out of time, you can press "restart" to try again.

        It's very easy to cheat the game by guessing until you get lucky, if you're just focused on getting a high score, so don't think too much about the score. It's just there to help you measure your improvement and set goals for yourself.

        If you're playing from a computer, you might prefer using the left and right arrow keys instead of the black and white buttons on screen (you can also use enter to restart).
